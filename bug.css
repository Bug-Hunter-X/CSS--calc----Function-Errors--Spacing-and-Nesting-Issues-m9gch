The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, unexpected behavior can occur if spaces are not correctly placed around the operators (+, -, *, /).  For example, `width:calc(20px + 10%);` works correctly, but `width:calc(20px+10%);` might not, depending on the browser and CSS engine.  Another issue can arise when using nested `calc()` functions without proper parentheses.  Incorrect nesting or missing parentheses can lead to unexpected results.
